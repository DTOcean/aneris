## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add gitignore.
- Add change log.
- Add Database.execute_transaction method which will commit a query immediately
  without returning results.
- Add Sequencer.refresh_interfaces and Hub.refresh_interface to replace
  interfaces in Hubs. Useful if interfaces have gone stale after saving.
- Add create_pool_subset method to DataStorage class. Given a pool and 
  datastate, his creates a new pool and datastate just containing the variables
  in the datastate.
- Added create_merged_state method to the Loader class. By default, this
  generates a merged pseudo state from a given simulation unless the simulation
  already has one stored.
  
### Changed

- Changed labelling of inputs in an interface in a pipeline that appear in a
  previous interface to say "overwritten" rather than "unavailable".
- In DataStorage._convert_box_to_data catch TypeErrors and pass with a warning
  when unpickling, if the warn_unpickle flag is True.
- In DataStorage._make_data allow data not in the data catalogue to pass with a
  warning if the warn_missing flag is True.
- Modify add_datastate in the Controller class so that it can take Data objects
  as the variable values in the use_objects flag is set to True.
  
### Fixed
  
- Removed unnecessary psycopg2 import
- Fixed bug in FileInterface.check_path
- Ensure SerialBox is replaced if encountering unknown data identifier when
  deserializing a data pool.
